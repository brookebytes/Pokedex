## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This project mostly consists of CSS as this makes up the styling of the ‘Pokedex’. The data is fetched and processed using JavaScript which calls on the PokeAPI. 

## Lessons Learned:

I started this project to challenge myself to make a design out of CSS. I learned more about using CSS to make a webpage more unique and fun, while remaining responsive and intentional.
